<h2 id="c3">THE WHITE-EYED VIREO.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Vireo noveboracensis.</i>)</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And then the wren and vireo</p>
<p class="t0">Begin with song to overflow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<span class="sc">Thomas Hill</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The vireos form a peculiar and interesting
family&mdash;the Vireonid&aelig;, which includes
about fifty species. All are strictly
American and the larger number inhabit
only the forest or shrubby regions
of Central and South America. The
name vireo signifies a green finch and
is from the Latin word meaning &ldquo;to be
green.&rdquo; The body color of nearly all the
species is more or less olive green.</p>
<p>About fifteen species frequent the
United States. These are all members
of the genus Vireo, and some of them
have a wide range, only equaled in extent
by some of the warblers.</p>
<p>Dr. Coues has said of these birds:
&ldquo;Next after the warblers the greenlets
(vireos) are the most delightful of our
forest birds, though their charms address
the ear and not the eye. Clad in
simple tints that harmonize with the
verdure, these gentle songsters warble
their lays unseen, while the foliage itself
seems stirred to music. In the quaint
and curious ditty of the white-eye, in the
earnest, voluble strains of the red-eye, in
the tender secret that the warbling vireo
confides in whispers to the passing
breeze, he is insensible who does not hear
the echo of thoughts he never clothes
in words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vireos are strikingly alike. In
habit, in color, in structure, in size and
in their home-building peculiarities they
resemble each other. Their eggs are similar
and &ldquo;fashioned almost as from the
same mold, and colored as if by the same
brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vireos build pensile nests that are
ingeniously concealed under the surrounding
foliage. They are in the form
of a rather deep cup, which is suspended
from two or more converging twigs. The
materials used in the construction are
similar in all cases, though they vary
somewhat according to the locality and
the abundance of desirable textiles. A
favorite substance used by some of the
birds is the tough and flexible fibers of
the inner bark of trees. Thoreau, speaking
of this habit, says: &ldquo;What a wonderful
genius it is that leads the vireo to
select the tough fiber of the inner bark
instead of the more brittle grasses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White-eyed Vireo has an extensive
range, extending over the eastern United
States from the Atlantic Ocean to the
great plains and from Mexico and Guatemala,
where it winters, northward to the
borders of British America. It nests
practically throughout its range within
the United States.</p>
<p>This pert and trim little bird is known
by other suggestive names. Because of
the character of its nest it is called the
&ldquo;little green hanging bird.&rdquo; Its song, as
translated by boys, has given it the name
&ldquo;chickty-bearer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;chickity.&rdquo; Except
when nesting this vireo is unsuspecting
and will permit a near approach. Dr.
Brewer says that &ldquo;when whistled to it
will often stop and eye you with marked
curiosity, and even approach a little
nearer, as if to obtain a better view, entirely
unconscious of any danger.&rdquo; Impertinent
at all times, they are especially
so when the nest is approached. At such
times it exhibits great uneasiness, and
even its expressive eyes seem to flash.
Continually scolding the intruder, it utters
&ldquo;a hoarse mewing that is very peculiar.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>The nest of the White-eyed Vireo is a
beautiful structure. It is artistic, durable
and a wonderfully pretty home for
its beautiful architect. It is seldom placed
higher than five feet from the ground.
Dr. Brewer thus describes one of these
nests. It was &ldquo;composed of a singular
medley of various materials, among
which may be noticed broken fragments
of dry leaves, bits of decayed wood and
bark, coarse blades of grass, various
fibers, lichens, fragments of insects,
mosses, straws, stems, etc. These were
all wrapped round and firmly bound together
with strong hempen fibers of vegetables.
Within this outer envelope was
an inner nest, made of the finer stems of
grasses and dry needles of the white pine,
firmly interwoven.&rdquo; There are usually
either three or four eggs, which are white
and speckled at the larger end, with black
or some shade of brown.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman says: &ldquo;I have always
regretted that the manners of this vireo
have been a bar to our better acquaintance,
for he is a bird of marked character
and with unusual vocal talents. He
is a capital mimic, and in the retirement
of his home sometimes amuses himself by
combining the songs of other birds in an
intricate potpourri.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c6">THE RIVOLI HUMMINGBIRD.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Eugenes fulgens.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>In that wonderful and magnificent book
&ldquo;A Monograph of the Trochilid&aelig;,&rdquo; the
family of hummingbirds, Mr. John Gould,
the author, writing of his experiences
with these mites of bird life, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How vivid is my recollection of the
first hummingbird which met my admiring
gaze! With what delight did I examine
its tiny body and feast my eyes on
its glittering plumage! These early impressions,
I well remember, gradually
increased into an earnest desire to attain
a more intimate acquaintance with the
lovely group of birds to which it pertained.
During the first twenty years
of my acquaintance with these wonderful
works of creation my thoughts were
often directed to them in the day, and
my dreams have not unfrequently carried
me to their native forests in the distant
country of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These birds have ever been an inspiration
to the poet. How beautiful are
these lines of Maurice Thompson, addressed
to the hummingbird:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">Zephyr loves thy wings</p>
<p class="t3">Above all lovable things,</p>
<p class="t0">And brings them gifts with rapturous murmurings.</p>
<p class="t0">Thine is the golden reach of blooming hours;</p>
<p class="t3">Spirit of flowers!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">Thou art a winged thought</p>
<p class="t3">Of tropical hours,</p>
<p class="t0">With all the tropics&rsquo; rare bloom-splendor frought;</p>
<p class="t0">Surcharged with beauty&rsquo;s indefinable powers,</p>
<p class="t3">Angel of flowers!</p>
</div>
<p>It seems cruel and strange that any
person should kill these tiny creatures
especially for ornamental purpose. They
are the gems of nature, yet one day, in
the year 1888, over twelve thousand skins
of hummingbirds were sold in London.
&ldquo;And in one week during the same year
there were sold at auction, in that city,
four hundred thousand hummingbirds
and other birds from North and South
America, the former doubtless comprising
a very considerable percentage of the
whole number.&rdquo; When we remember
that the hummingbird lays but two eggs,
the rapid extermination of some of the
species is evident unless this wholesale
slaughter is stopped. Even the tropics,
where bird life is wonderfully abundant,
cannot support such wanton destruction.</p>
<p>The Rivoli, or the Refulgent hummingbird,
as it is frequently called, has
a very limited range. It is found in the
&ldquo;mountains of southeastern Arizona,
southwestern New Mexico and over the
table lands of Mexico,&rdquo; southward to
Nicaragua. It is one of the largest and
most beautiful of the hummingbirds that
frequent the United States. Its royal
appearance led Lesson, in the year 1829,
to name it Rivoli, in honor of M. Massena,
the Duke of Rivoli. It is noted
&ldquo;for the beauty of its coloring and the
bold style of its markings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Salvin, writing of the pugnacious
character of this species, says: &ldquo;Many
a time have I thought to secure a fine
male, which I had, perhaps, been following
from tree to tree, and had at last
seen quietly perched on a leafless twig,
when my deadly intention has been anticipated
by one less so in fact, but to
all appearances equally so in will. Another
hummingbird rushes in, knocks the
one I covet off his perch, and the two go
fighting and screaming away at a pace
hardly to be followed by the eye. Another
time this flying fight was sustained
in midair, the belligerents mounting
higher and higher, until the one worsted
in battle darts away seeking shelter, followed
by the victor, who never relinquishes
the pursuit till the vanquished,
by doubling and hiding, succeeds in making
his escape.&rdquo; Not only do they resent
the presence of their own kind, but also
of other hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Mr. H. W. Henshaw, who was the
first scientist to discover that the Rivoli
was a member of the bird fauna of the
United States, thus describes its nest:
&ldquo;It is composed of mosses nicely woven
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
into an almost circular cup, the interior
possessing a lining of the softest and
downiest feathers, while the exterior is
elaborately covered with lichens, which
are securely bound on by a network of
the finest silk from spiders&rsquo; webs. It
was saddled on the horizontal limb of
an alder, about twenty feet above the bed
of a running mountain stream, in a glen
which was overarched and shadowed by
several huge spruces, making it one of
the most shady and retired nooks that
could be imagined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note of this bird gem of the pine-clad
mountains is a &ldquo;twittering sound,
louder, not so shrill and uttered more
slowly than those of the small hummers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Rivoli hovers over the mescal
and gathers from its flowers the numerous
insects that infest them; or, as it
takes the sweets from the flowers of the
boreal honeysuckle, one is reminded of
the words of the poet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Art thou a bird, a bee, or butterfly?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Each and all three&mdash;a bird in shape am I,</p>
<p class="t0">A bee collecting sweets from bloom to bloom,</p>
<p class="t0">A butterfly in brilliancy of plume.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE BIRD OF CONSOLATION.</h2>
<p>There is a Scandinavian tradition that
the swallow hovered over the cross of
our Lord crying &ldquo;Svala! Svala!&rdquo; (Console,
console). Hence comes its name,
&ldquo;svalow&rdquo;&mdash;the bird of consolation.</p>
<p>The habitat of the swallow is the whole
of North America and parts of South
America. The chief characteristic is
usually a deeply forked tail. The swallows
of this country are called Bank,
Barn, Bridge, Chimney, Cliff, Tree,
Land, Purple, Violet, Black, White,
Crescent, Green, Blue, Republican,
White-billed and White-fronted. There
are some twenty common kinds, beside
the Swift, which is called a swallow because
of certain resemblances. But its
structure is different. It has its name
from the rapidity of its flight. It is almost
always on the wing. Its feet are so
seldom used that they are very weak.
The chimney swallow has a bristly tail,
which assists in its support when the
bird alights. Its color is a sooty gray.
Of the true swallows none is more familiar
than the barn swallow, whose nest
adds a picturesque interest to the eaves
of the building. This swallow has a
steel blue coat, a pale chestnut vest, with
a bit of chocolate on chin and throat.
The tail is deeply forked. It is not a
noisy bird, but has a song&mdash;a little trill&mdash;aside
from the note it uses when flying.
Like a merry laugh, it says &ldquo;Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee.&rdquo;
The barn swallow is sympathetic
with its mates when they are in
trouble and is friendly to man, who
sometimes feels like questioning it&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Is it far to heaven, O Swallow, Swallow!</p>
<p class="t">The heavy-hearted sings;</p>
<p class="t0">I watch thy flight&mdash;and I long to follow.</p>
<p class="t">The while I wait for wings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The flight of the swallow is in the
curved line, which is that of beauty, and
is without effort or restraint.</p>
<p>The cliff swallow, petrochelidon lunifrons&mdash;gets
part of its name&mdash;lunifrons
(moon front)&mdash;from its white, crescent-like
frontlet. It builds a bottle or gourd-shaped
nest under the protection of
shelving cliffs. A whole colony will
sometimes build under the eaves of out-buildings,
when the shape of the nest is
modified. This bird may be distinguished
from the barn swallow by its
less forked tail and its blackish color.
It is a very useful bird, as it seems tireless
in its destruction of injurious insects.</p>
<p>The tree or white-billed swallow wears
a bluish-green coat, with white vest. It
will sometimes rob the woodpecker of
holes in trees in which to build.</p>
<p>The bank swallow or sand martin is
the cosmopolitan of birds, as it thrives
equally well in Asia, Africa, Europe and
America.</p>
<p>Of all the swallows none is a greater
favorite than the purple martin. It was
doubtless the bird to which Shakespeare
alludes when he says, &ldquo;Where the temple
haunting martlet breeds the air is delicate.&rdquo;
The purple martin, in iridescent
coat, with soft, musical cry of &ldquo;Peuo-peuo-peuo,&rdquo;
is a well protected guest,
provided with pretty boxes for homes on
tall poles or nailed to the sides of trees.
It is a courageous bird, defending its
home and young against any ruthless
invader.</p>
<p>There is an old true saying that &ldquo;one
swallow does not make a summer.&rdquo; Yet
its advent is looked for as the harbinger
of warm weather.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE WORM-EATING WARBLER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Helmitherus vermivorus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Worm-eating Warbler is much
more retiring and less often noticed than
most of the species of warblers. Unlike
many of the species its range does not
reach to the northern coniferous forests.
Passing the winter in the countries bordering
the Gulf of Mexico, it migrates in
the spring throughout the Eastern United
States, breeding as far north as Illinois
and Connecticut. Its dull color and retiring
and shy disposition eminently fit
it for its chosen hunting grounds&mdash;the
deep and thick woods, bordering ravines,
where there is an abundant undergrowth
of shrubs. Though preferring such localities,
it is occasionally seen in rather
open places.</p>
<p>Its companion in the woods is the golden-crowned
thrush, for which it might
easily be mistaken were it not for the absence
of streaks on its breast. Its song
closely resembles that of the chipping
sparrow and may even mislead the
trained field ornithologist. As it deliberately
hunts for insects among the dry
leaves on the ground or on the lower
branches of shrubs, its slow motions are
more like those of the vireo than of a
warbler.</p>
<p>While walking through woods frequented
by this rare little warbler the
experiences of Mr. Leander Keyser is
that of all who have had the pleasure of
meeting it among the trees. He says:
&ldquo;Suddenly there was a twinkle of wings,
a flash of olive-green, a sharp chirp, and
then before me, a few rods away, a little
bird went hopping about on the ground,
picking up dainties from the brown
leaves. It was a rare Worm-eating Warbler.
The little charmer was quite wary,
chirping nervously while I ogled him&mdash;for
it was a male&mdash;and then hopped up
into a sapling and finally scurried away
out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It builds its nest on the ground among
the dead leaves and under the protecting
shade of large leaved herbage or low
shrubs. The nest is rather large for the
size of the bird. Grasses, small roots,
the fibrous shreds of bark and a few dried
leaves are used in its construction.</p>
<p>Regarding the habits of this warbler
Dr. Coues writes as follows: &ldquo;It is a
sedate, rather a demure, little bird, without
the vivacity of most warblers. When
startled from the dead leaves on the
ground, where it spends most of its time
rambling, like the golden-crowned thrush,
it flies to a low limb and then often sits
motionless or hops listlessly about.&rdquo;</p>

asked Aunt Doris as the caterpillar
curled itself up in a little ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, kill it, quick as ever you can,&rdquo;
replied Neva promptly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
horrid old caterpillars crawling &rsquo;round
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a beautiful butterfly lighted
on the vine near by and Aunt Doris questioned,
&ldquo;Shall I catch the butterfly and
kill that, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, auntie, how could you kill a beautiful
butterfly?&rdquo; exclaimed the little girl.
&ldquo;Catch it, though, I&rsquo;d love to see it close
to. But there, now!&rdquo; she added in a disappointed
tone as the butterfly flitted
away, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone; they always fly away
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Doris went back to her chair
carrying the caterpillar in the leaf with
her. She seemed to be studying it for a
moment and then asked, &ldquo;Do you know
what I have here, Neva?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that caterpillar,&rdquo; answered the
little girl in a surprised tone. Then
growing curious she left the hammock
and went nearer her aunt&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;you are right,
yet if I should keep it long enough it
would turn into a butterfly just like the
one that flew away a moment ago; but I
suppose I had better kill it as you wish
me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Neva quickly
as her aunt started from her chair, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know &rsquo;bout it&rsquo;s ever being a butterfly.
Will it really be like that other
one, and could you keep it long enough;
and how can you tell what kind of a butterfly
it will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Doris laughed as she said,
&ldquo;Three questions all in one breath. I
know it will be that kind of a butterfly
because I&rsquo;ve studied about butterflies and
caterpillars. It has another name beside
caterpillar and that is larva. It is a very
good name for it means a mask. You
know when a thing is masked you can&rsquo;t
tell quite what it is by its looks and so
you might call this caterpillar a masked
butterfly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is a good name,&rdquo; said Neva,
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause I never would guess it was going
to be a butterfly; but can we keep it
until it isn&rsquo;t masked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will run and ask Nora for
a small pasteboard box we will fix a
house for it,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>Neva ran into the kitchen and soon
returned with a shoe-box asking, &ldquo;Will
this do? It&rsquo;s the littlest one there was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will make a nice, roomy
house,&rdquo; replied her aunt, laying the caterpillar
gently in the box. Then taking
a piece of netting from her work basket
she tied it over the top in place of the
cover. &ldquo;Now it will have plenty of light
and air,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The next thing will
be to get it something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do caterpillars like?&rdquo; asked
Neva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly leaves,&rdquo; replied her aunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is one leaf in the box;
won&rsquo;t it eat that?&rdquo; asked the little girl,
watching the caterpillar crawling over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, caterpillars are very particular
about their food; they all eat
leaves, but different kinds of caterpillars
eat different kinds of leaves. This kind
feeds on the leaves of the milk-weed.
The butterfly is always very careful to
lay the eggs on the plant whose leaves
supply the food of the caterpillar so when
the little caterpillar comes out of the tiny
egg its food is all ready for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Doris! How can butterflies
ever know so much? They don&rsquo;t eat
leaves, do they?&rdquo; asked Neva in a surprised
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, butterflies eat honey and overripe
fruit and such things; it is indeed
wonderful that they can select the right
plant, but the One who made the butterfly
gave it wonderful instinct. Who is
He, Neva?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Father,&rdquo; answered the little girl.
&ldquo;I know that we sing in school:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The little sparrow falleth not</p>
<p class="t0">But Jesus taketh heed.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but I never thought of His paying much
attention to such a little thing as butterflies.
I&rsquo;m not afraid of this caterpillar
now; I just, almost, pretty nearly love
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Doris smiled, then setting the
box upon the railing she said: &ldquo;This
caterpillar must have taken quite a journey;
we will go down the road a ways
and see if we can find some milk-weed
leaves for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neva ran ahead and her bright eyes
soon discovered the leaves. When they
had been placed in the box the little girl
sat and watched the caterpillar make a
good meal, while her aunt explained to
her how it would first become a chrysalis
and then a butterfly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long does it have to be a caterpillar?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty or thirty days,&rdquo; answered
Aunt Doris. &ldquo;But I think that this one
is quite old and will hang itself up before
long now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell, auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judge by the color and size. When
this caterpillar is very young it is greenish,
but as it grows older it casts its skin
several times; each time it grows brighter
and weighs more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how can it ever cast off its
skin?&rdquo; questioned Neva in astonishment.</p>
<p>Aunt Doris smiled as she replied:
&ldquo;Wait until it is ready to become a chrysalis
and you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neva kept close watch of her new pet
after that, she was so afraid some change
might take place that she did not see.
When bedtime came her aunt let her take
the box up to her room and put it on the
dresser that she might look at it the first
thing in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we have a name for this
creature?&rdquo; Neva asked while she was
getting ready for bed. &ldquo;I mean a real
name spelled with a capital, like mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it gets to be a butterfly it will
have a name,&rdquo; replied her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will it be?&rdquo; asked Neva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danais,&rdquo; replied Aunt Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danais,&rdquo; repeated Neva, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
pretty name, let&rsquo;s call it that now. There
isn&rsquo;t any last name to it, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, there is another name,&rdquo;
said her aunt, &ldquo;but it is a pretty long
one. It is Archippus, Danais Archippus;
can you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Neva, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it over
lots of times and then I&rsquo;ll never forget
it,&rdquo; and when Aunt Doris went past the
door a little later she heard a very sleepy
voice saying &ldquo;Danais Archippus, Danais
Archippus, Archippus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next two days the caterpillar
crawled around in the box and ate or
slept and although Neva looked at it
anxiously many times she could see no
change and she was beginning to feel a
little impatient. Early the third morning
she was awakened by a robin which
was singing in a tree near her window.
Almost before she had her eyes open she
jumped out of bed and ran over to look
in the box. A moment later Aunt Doris
heard a mournful little voice saying:
&ldquo;Danais Archippus, I just believe you&rsquo;re
a goner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, little girl, you are an
early bird; is there trouble in the box?&rdquo;
she said going over to the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There don&rsquo;t seem to be anything in
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
the box,&rdquo; answered Neva in a sorrowful
tone.</p>
<p>Aunt Doris gave one look and then she
laughed. &ldquo;Why, Neva, the sandman is
still in your eyes, for you are looking at
the bottom of the box and here is the caterpillar
hung up on the netting by the little
hooks in the tail. It is well that you
wakened so early, for half an hour later
our Danais Archippus would have been
a chrysalis and you never could have
seen it cast its skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then putting a soft shawl around the
little girl she took her in her lap and let
her hold the box.</p>
<p>Very soon the caterpillar commenced
rolling off its skin, but although Neva
watched every minute and almost held
her breath, she could scarcely tell how a
little, green case, which looked as though
it might be made of wax, was hanging
where the caterpillar had hung a few
moments before, while the old skin lay
shriveled up in the bottom of the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful, auntie?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;How can God make so many beautiful
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very beautiful,&rdquo; replied her
aunt, &ldquo;but it will be more so after a little;
we will set the box up now and look
again after you are dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, auntie,&rdquo; Neva called
a little later. &ldquo;The green case is a prettier
color now and it has a row of such
cute little gold knobs near the top. What
do you s&rsquo;pose they are there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You notice that they are placed just
where the chrysalis bulges; they are put
there to protect the little sleeper when
the wind blows the case against anything.
You know a chrysalis is usually
suspended from a leaf out of doors, and
so it needs some such protection,&rdquo; explained
Aunt Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now how long will this be just a
chrysalis and will it just hang and do
nothing?&rdquo; asked the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are watching it closely you
will see that it sometimes swings towards
the light and sometimes away from the
light just as its needs require. It is a
sensitive little mummy. But my little
Neva will have to be very patient for it
may be twelve or even sixteen days before
the butterfly appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good I&rsquo;m making you a long visit,&rdquo;
said Neva, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause I wouldn&rsquo;t like
to go home before the butterfly came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After ten days had passed the chrysalis
began to look a little darker and the
twelfth day Neva said, &ldquo;Auntie, I
b&rsquo;lieve I see something that looks like a
wing inside of this little case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, enough,&rdquo; said Aunt Doris.
&ldquo;That means that Danais Archippus will
soon come out of the little green house.&rdquo;
Almost before she had finished speaking
the case began to move and then the part
that was over the butterfly&rsquo;s back burst
and a crumpled little object dropped to
the bottom of the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what mussed up wings!&rdquo; exclaimed
Neva in an excited whisper, but
already the butterfly had commenced distending
them and soon they looked three
times the size and were all smoothed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will he fly?&rdquo; asked Neva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the wings are still drooping a
little because they are moist; he will
move them back and forth after a little,
but will not fly until they are perfectly
dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he just a beauty! How I wish
mamma could see how he looks,&rdquo; said the
little girl in a longing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to have auntie
paint his picture before he is ready to
fly away?&rdquo; asked her aunt.</p>
<p>Neva&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Oh, will you?&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run and get your
paints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the Danais was
taken from the box and placed on the
tablespread and Aunt Doris&rsquo; brush was
doing rapid work.</p>
<p>Neva was fascinated as her eyes traveled
from her live butterfly to the beautiful
deep orange wings trimmed with
black and white which her aunt was
painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Aunt Doris,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
zact match, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;most a reg&rsquo;lar twin.
How large it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is four and a half inches
across the wings. It is the largest kind of
an American butterfly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the painting was finished
the butterfly commenced flitting about
the room. It soon found its way to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
screen door and Neva said, &ldquo;It looks just
as if it was coaxing to go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, butterflies don&rsquo;t like to be shut
up in the house,&rdquo; said Aunt Doris, &ldquo;and
I think a certain little girl must want to
play out too by this time, so I&rsquo;ll open the
door and watch you both fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later a happy little
voice called from the lawn, &ldquo;Oh, just look,
auntie, Danais Archippus seems to be
kissing all the flowers, he&rsquo;s so glad to see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Neva went back to the city she
took the picture of the Danais which
her aunt had framed in a pretty gold
frame, and also a great bunch of milkweed
pods. She looked at them very
proudly as her aunt put them in her
trunk and said, &ldquo;They will be such beautiful
reminderments of my precious Danais
Archippus, though of course I would
remember him forever even if I didn&rsquo;t
have them, wouldn&rsquo;t I, auntie?&rdquo; and Aunt
Doris looked into the earnest little face
and smiled and felt sure that she would.</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE INDIGNANT TURKEY.
<br /><span class="small">A TRUE STORY.</span></h2>
<p>Near the pretty town of Madison, N.
J., a turkey hen was at one time sitting
on her nest of eggs. She knew that she
must forego many a pleasant excursion
about the poultry yard and through the
meadows, where she and her mate had
often picked up a sweet wormy meal.
As the days grew into weeks Mr. Turkey
Gobbler seemed to realize it, too, and decided
to put up with widowhood no longer.
So he visited a neighboring farm
and enticed a good-natured lady turkey
to return with him to his home. The
patient, lawful wife, hatching her eggs,
could do nothing about it. Her place
was on the nest, and although doubtless
her breast was ruffled with waves of
jealousy, she had no means of avenging
herself. But the day of retributive justice
was surely and swiftly approaching.
Hearing a great commotion in the barnyard
one morning soon after the new
turkey had been introduced to the fowls,
the householder hurried out to investigate.
There he found a strange turkey
cock thrashing with all his might of
claw, wing and beak the robber of his
nest and affections, after which he proudly
walked off with his mate, leaving the
defeated and disloyal bird to make peace
as best he could with her of whom he
was not worthy.</p>

<br />(Spizella socialis.)
<br />About Life-size.
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c13">THE CHIPPING SPARROW.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Spizella socialis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Chipping Sparrow visits the temperate
regions of Eastern North America
at that time of the year of which the poet
Tennyson has said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now fades the last long streak of snow,</p>
<p class="t">Now bourgeons every maze of quick</p>
<p class="t">About the flowering squares, and thick</p>
<p class="t0">By ashen rootes the violets blow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>With the advancing seasons it passes
still farther northward, till at last some
of these birds have established their
homes in Newfoundland and Southern
Canada. They nest and rear their young
from the Gulf States to the northern limits
of their range.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman has truthfully said:
&ldquo;The Chippy is among sparrows what
the ph&oelig;be is among flycatchers&mdash;the
humblest, most unassuming member of
its family. Both show trustfulness,
which, in spite of their unattractive appearance
and far from pleasing voices,
win our affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few of our feathered friends are more
confiding or will show more confidence in
us, especially when by quiet, kindly acts
we attract them to our doorsteps. They
love the habitations of man and will select
the vines and bushes of the door-yard
in which to build their homes. The
name Social Sparrow is fully as appropriate
as Chipping Sparrow. The latter
name is derived from their song, which
is best described as a &ldquo;monotonous chippy-chippy-chippy-chippy,&rdquo;
ending at times in a quiet trill. Their happy dispositions
and busy lives are inspiring.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Bid the little homely sparrows,</p>
<p class="t">Chirping in the cold and rain,</p>
<p class="t0">Their impatient, sweet complaining,</p>
<p class="t">Sing out from their hearts again;</p>
<p class="t0">Bid them set themselves to mating,</p>
<p class="t">Cooing love in softest words,</p>
<p class="t0">Crowd their nests, all cold and empty,</p>
<p class="t">Full of little callow birds.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The song of the Chippy lasts about
four seconds and is repeated at frequent
intervals throughout the day. They &ldquo;frequently
repeat their trills in the darkness
of night when restless or disturbed.&rdquo;
Mr. Silloway has estimated that &ldquo;if their
total practice through the day amounts
to five hours, it is probable that they utter
more than two thousand songs in a
day, and perhaps even more; a wonderful
record for these little musicians.&rdquo;
The ground, the fence, the porch or a
shrub serve alike as a rostrum from
which, with uplifted heads, to utter their
trills.</p>
<p>Were it not for the English sparrow
the yards of our country residences would
be alive with these companionable birds.
They not only enjoy the society of man,
but also the presence of their own kind.
The male is very attentive and will share
food that he has obtained with his mate,
for whom he shows the greatest fondness.
In fact, the love for each other
exhibited by a pair of these sparrows is
remarkable. Then, too, their attachment
for the home bush, in which they have
passed a happy season, is frequently
shown by their returning to the same
bush or one near by, not only the next
season, but probably for several.</p>
<p>The delicate little home of the Chippy
is sometimes a neatly and closely woven
fabrication of the hairs of horses and
cows. Because of this habit of using hair
in its nest the Chippy is frequently called
the Hairbird. More often, however, the
hair is used in the lining, which is protected
by an outer wall made of grasses,
fine roots and twigs. The nest is seldom
placed less than five feet from the ground.
In this home, with its feltlike lining, are
laid the four or five bluish green eggs,
the larger ends of which are speckled
with brown or black. The Chippy is not
contented with a single family and usually
raises two in a season.</p>
<p>The patient devotion of the parent
birds to their young is very interesting.
They teach the little birds to gather their
own food and carefully guard them till
they have gained sufficient strength and
confidence to care for themselves. Even
then parents and offspring remain near
each other, lovingly feeding in the same
pasture, till the cold autumn drives them
to their summer home in the Southern
States and Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHRISTMAS IN BUNNYVILLE.</h2>
<p>It was Christmas Eve in Bunnyville.
Bunnyville was in a lovely great forest,
and was the place where all the rabbits
lived. Mr. and Mrs. Hare and six baby
hares lived in a nice hollow tree, by the
side of a clear stream of water, so that
they never suffered for a cool drink or a
bath. The little Hares were very much
excited tonight, and were staying up far
beyond the usual time, because they had
so much to talk about, and were wondering
what the morrow would bring. Now,
this was to be the first time in their
little lives that these dear little rabbits
had ever hung up their stockings, for
their papa and mamma had not known
until recently that there was such a thing
as Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Mamma Hare saw that her little soft,
wooly babies were getting too much excited,
so she said to them, &ldquo;Now, children,
you really must go to bed, or the
Santa rabbit will not come to you at all,
and then how will you feel? Come!
Hurry, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they all scampered toward the
mamma and gave her a good hug, with
their little furry arms, and jumped into
bed, all six of them in a row. The mamma
leaned over them, and tucked them
all in snugly, pulling the long gray moss
up close around their necks, for the night
was bitter cold, and the wind was howling
fiercely around their tree home.
Then she kissed each one, but her way
of doing this was to rub her nose against
each one of the little wrinkled noses, and
that was a rabbit kiss.</p>
<p>They were soon sound asleep, and Mr.
and Mrs. Hare were just dozing off, too,
when they heard a queer, scratching
sound, outside of their big tree, and they
lay there peeping out from the moss with
their bright eyes until suddenly, through
the hole in the tree, there stepped&mdash;old
Santa. He was a big&mdash;a very big&mdash;white
rabbit, with long ears, and pink eyes, and
long whiskers. He had such a kind face
that they were almost tempted to speak
to him, but they were afraid if they did
he might get scared, and run away, before
filling the stockings. Those were
the funniest stockings you ever saw. Of
course, the little rabbits did not wear
stockings, only when it was very cold,
they sometimes put on extra fur shoes
to play in the snow. So the mamma had
made each one a nice, large one, to hang
up, and there they hung in a row, on
some pegs driven to the inside of the
tree. Old Santa looked around a minute,
and soon spied these queer fur
stockings; but he was used to that, for
all the little bunnies he had visited that
night had that same kind, so, with a low
chuckle to himself, he took a big fur
bag off his shoulders and reaching down
into it he drew forth the loveliest things
papa and mamma rabbit had ever seen.
Their eyes fairly sparkled, as they
thought of how delighted their babies
would be when they awoke. Santa Claus
did not forget anybody&mdash;not even papa
and mamma, for they saw him stuffing
a lot of things down at the foot of their
bed, as he laughed to think of their surprise.
When he left they jumped out of
bed, and peeked through the tree, and
saw him leap into a sleigh which was
made out of a big, big pumpkin and
drawn by tiny white mice. Their little
silver bells tinkled as they flew over the
snow&mdash;for the whole world outside was
now covered with a beautiful sparkling
robe of snow. The rabbits were awake
long before the dawn next morning, and
made such a noise, giggling and whispering,
under their cover of moss, that
the mamma could not sleep. Finally they
said: &ldquo;O, mamma, can&rsquo;t we get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess you might as well,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;as you won&rsquo;t go to sleep.&rdquo; So
out they scampered, all six of them,
tumbling all over each other in their
eagerness to see what good old Santa had
brought them. O, how delighted they
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
were, as they ran their little paws down
into each fur stocking, and brought
forth the most wonderful things, surely,
that rabbits ever had.</p>
<p>There were little red apples, and all
kinds of nuts, and nice green things to
eat, and actually, a doll, made out of
cornstalks, and corn-silk for hair. They
had never had a doll before, and they
hugged them to their little furry breasts
with ecstasy. When the children were all
through looking at their gifts the papa
and mamma looked at the foot of their
bed and found the things Santa had
brought them. There were bushels of
red and yellow apples, bags of wheat,
great cabbages and celery, tender lettuce
and all the good things so dear to the
heart of a rabbit.</p>
<p>Dear, dear! Their mouths fairly
watered, as they looked at these things.
More than enough to last them all winter,
and now they would not have to go
out in the cold, bitter weather, searching
for something to eat. They could stay in
their good warm tree, and have a jolly
time together, and eat all the good things
they wanted. After breakfast the children
all ran out and played snowball and
frolicked around at leap-frog and such
outdoor sports all morning, which made
them so hungry that they felt as if they
could eat up the whole lot of winter supplies.
After a while mamma called them
in, and they joyfully sat down to their
Christmas dinner. There was a long
table, just filled with good things, and
the children all sat on big strong toadstools.
My! how hungry they were. But
mamma had known they would be, and
had provided everything good that a rabbit
likes, and actually had some tiny
cakes, and little red candies. What a
jolly meal that was! Everybody laughing
and chewing away at something held
tightly between their two little front
paws, and wrinkling up their funny
brown noses, smelling at all the good
things on the table. It was quite late
when they finished the merry meal, and
after looking for some time at the things
which Santa had brought, papa and mamma
said: &ldquo;Children, we have another
surprise for you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another surprise! What could it be?
It seemed to them that they already had
every surprise in the world, and they
could not imagine how anything else
could be thought of.</p>
<p>Mamma made each of them put on a
very heavy fur coat, and fur shoes, and
they all went out, and went skipping
over the cold white snow, until at last,
through the darkness they caught a
glimpse of something sparkling, and
bright and beautiful. Bright lights hung
everywhere, and in the center of it all
was a tree&mdash;that was not like any tree
they had ever seen before in all their
little rabbit lives. It was a rabbit Christmas
tree, just covered with beautiful
gifts for all, and there all around the tree
were dozens and dozens of rabbits many
of whom were friends of theirs, and
what a jolly crowd it was. Everybody
good natured, and all jumping and hopping,
as if their lives depended upon it.
Pretty soon from out the darkness who
should appear but Santa himself? O,
what hurrying and scurrying of little
furry feet there was, as all the little bunnies
tried to get near him. He smiled
upon them all as he stepped to the tree
and began handing gifts to each and
every one of them. And the funniest part
of it was, that he knew every one of
their names. After the gifts had all been
distributed they all joined hands around
Santa Claus, and went around in the
wildest, merriest dance, that was ever
danced by a party of rabbits. So light of
feet and so happy were they that they
fairly flew over the ground. Then the
good old Santa told them good-by till
next year, and jumping into his sleigh,
vanished from sight. They all went
home very tired, but O, so very, very
happy to be tucked away again into
their soft, warm nests of gray moss.</p>

<h2 id="c15">TOPAZ.</h2>
<p>Remarkable clearness and transparency,
capacity of taking a high polish
and hardness and weight greater than
that of quartz. These are the qualities
in which Topaz excels as a gem. Numerous
other stones of inferior quality
masquerade under its name, however,
and this fact may account for the decline
in popularity which the stone has
suffered in recent years. True Topaz is
a silicate of alumina, containing hydroxyl
and fluorine. Its hardness is 8 in the
scale in which quartz is 7. Hence it will
scratch the latter mineral and may thus
be distinguished from it. It is also remarkably
heavy, considering its composition,
it being three and one-half times
as heavy as water, while quartz is only
two and one-half times as heavy. Owing
to this unusual specific gravity, experts
accustomed to handling gems can frequently
pick out the Topaz from a miscellaneous
lot of precious stones without removing
their wrappings.</p>
<p>The color typically associated with Topaz
in its use as a gem is yellow. Yet
the mineral species exhibits many other
shades of color, which, when present in
crystals of sufficient clearness and purity,
answer equally well for gem purposes.
These other shades, most of which are
represented in the accompanying plate,
are grayish, greenish, bluish and reddish.
Topaz may also be quite colorless. The
yellow color of the Brazilian Topaz can
be changed by heating to a pale rose pink
and the gem is often treated in this way.
The degree of heat employed is not high,
and both heating and cooling must be
performed gradually. Warming in a
sand bath at a low red heat is the method
usually employed, or the stone may be
wrapped in German tinder and the latter
set on fire. Only stones of a brown yellow
color yield the pink; the pale yellow
stones turn white when so treated. Once
the pink color is obtained it is permanent.
The natural colors of Topaz are
in general perfectly durable, although
some of the deep wine yellow Topazes
from Russia fade on exposure to daylight.</p>
<p>Topaz is infusible before the blowpipe.
It is not affected by hydrochloric
acid, but is partially decomposed by sulphuric
acid and then yields hydrofluoric
acid. If the latter experiment is tried
in a closed glass tube the formation of
the hydrofluoric acid is made evident by
the etching and clouding of the walls of
the tube. The powdered stone should
be mixed with acid sulphate of potash
for this experiment. The powdered mineral,
when heated with cobalt nitrate,
assumes a fine blue color, due to the
alumina which it contains. One of the
most convenient means of distinguishing
Topaz from other stones used to imitate
it is through its property of becoming
electric by heat, friction or pressure.
This electrical condition is evidenced, as
in the case of tourmaline, by the power
the stone acquires to pick up and hold
bits of tissue paper, straws, etc. Sometimes
the friction from merely rubbing
the stone between the fingers will be sufficient
to produce this electrical condition,
while many Brazilian Topazes, if
simply pressed between the fingers, especially
in the direction of the prismatic
axis, become electric. The electrical
condition often persists from twenty-four
to thirty hours.</p>
<p>The crystals of Topaz belong to the
orthorhombic system of crystallization.
They are usually elongated in the direction
of the prism and have sharp, bright
faces. They vary much in size and often
are large. One crystal weighing
twenty-five pounds was found in Siberia.</p>
<p>A well-marked characteristic of all Topaz
crystals is their tendency to cleave
across the prism parallel with its base.
Such a cleavage plane can be seen cutting
across the crystal shown in the upper
right-hand corner of the accompanying
plate. This cleavage is so marked
and the cleavage plane so bright and flat
that in cutting Topaz for a gem a cleavage
surface is used as the upper face of
the gem and the other faces formed
around it. Owing to this easy cleavage
the owner of a cut Topaz should be careful
not to let the stone drop, as it might
be cracked or broken.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>The name Topaz is derived from the
Greek name topazios, which is that of
an island in the Red Sea. The gem
known to the ancients as topaz, however,
was not our Topaz, but the mineral chrysolite.
Topaz usually occurs in gneiss
or granite, with tourmaline, mica, beryl,
etc. In Brazil it occurs in a talcose rock
or in mica slate. It is sometimes in sufficient
abundance to form an essential
rock constituent. When so occurring,
however, it has not the transparent gem
quality, but is white and opaque. Much
of the Brazilian Topaz occurs as rolled
pebbles, one of which is shown in the
accompanying plate. These occur in the
beds of streams, having been left behind
owing to their superior hardness after
the rock in which they were formed has
been washed away. When colorless
they are known in the region as &ldquo;pingos
d&rsquo;Agua&rdquo; (drops of water). The Portuguese
call them &ldquo;slaves&rsquo; diamonds.&rdquo; A
stone in the crown of Portugal, reputed
to be a diamond of 1,680 carats weight
and called the Braganza, is undoubtedly
only a Topaz of exceptional clearness and
beauty.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Topazes come mostly
from the Province of Minas Geraes, the
province which also yields diamonds,
beryls and many other precious stones.
While those of greenish and bluish
shades are found mostly in the form of
rolled pebbles the yellow Brazilian Topaz
is found in the mother rock. This is a
decomposed itacolumite of a white or
yellow color. The Russian Topazes, like
that shown in the plate, come from the
Imperial mines in the Urals. Alabashka,
near Mursinka, is one of the most productive
localities. The crystals occur in
cavities in granite and are accompanied
by crystals of smoky quartz, feldspar
and mica. Superb gems are cut from
these Topazes, a fine series of which is
possessed by the Field Columbian Museum.
The mines are operated by the
Russian Government and the finest specimens
are reserved for the Imperial Cabinet.</p>
<p>In the southern Urals, in the gold
washings of the River Sanarka, yellow
Topazes are found closely resembling
those of Brazil. Associated with them
are amethysts, rubies, chrysoberyls and
many other precious stones. Topaz crystals
of good size and color are found
quite abundantly in Japan, although they
have not yet been cut for gems to any
extent. There are many localities in the
United States where Topaz occurs, and it
is often of gem quality. The group
shown in the plate illustrates its occurrence
at Thomas Mountain, Utah, a locality
forty miles north of Sevier Lake.
The crystals are found in cavities in the
rock. They are never very large, but
are usually clear and bright. They occur
in somewhat similar fashion at Nathrop,
Colorado. In the Eastern States
Topaz was first found at Trumbull, Conn.
It is here quite opaque and not suitable
for gem purposes. Good gem Topaz has
been found at Huntington and Middletown,
Conn., however, and especially at
Stoneham, Maine. In these localities it
occurs in granite.</p>
<p>Of other stones which are sold under
the name of Topaz the most common is
the so-called Spanish or Saxon topaz.
This is simply smoky quartz heated until
it turns a yellow color. It can easily
be distinguished from true Topaz by the
properties above given.</p>
<p>At the present time it is also quite the
common practice to vend ordinary colorless
quartz under the name of Topaz.
These practices are harmful to the reputation
of true Topaz, as these forms of
quartz are common and cheap and lack
many of the desirable qualities of that
stone. There is also a so-called Oriental
Topaz which is a yellow form of corundum.
It is heavier and harder than
true Topaz, but its color and luster are
not generally considered as desirable as
those of that mineral. About forty years
ago Topaz was quite popular as a gem
and commanded three or four times its
present price. At the present not more
than two dollars a carat is often paid for
the stone.</p>
<p>Topaz is often referred to by ancient
writers and is mentioned in the Bible as
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
one of the stones to be put in the ephod
of the high priest; also as one of the
gems worn by the King of Tyre and
as forming one of the gates of the Holy
City. Curiously enough, the gem referred
to in these instances was the modern
chrysolite, while where chrysolite is
spoken of our Topaz is usually meant.</p>
<p>A Topaz presented by Lady Hildegarde,
wife of Theodoric, Count of Holland,
to a monastery in her native town,
emitted at night, according to legend, a
light so brilliant that in the chapel where
it was kept prayers could be read at night
without the aid of a light; a statement
which might well be true if the monks
knew the prayers by heart.</p>
<p>The spiritual qualities associated with
Topaz are fruitfulness and faithfulness.
It is also said to confer cheerfulness upon
its wearer. The ancients believed that
it calmed the passions and prevented bad
dreams; that it discovered poison by becoming
obscured when in contact with
it; that it quenched the heat of boiling
water, and that its powers increased and
decreased with the increase and decrease
of the moon. Also a Topaz held in the
hand of a woman at childbirth was believed
to lessen suffering. Lastly, a Topaz
is the gem of the month of November:</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;Encircled with poetic atmosphere,</p>
<p class="t0">As lark emballed by its own crystal song.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>might be the fulfillment of the poet&rsquo;s
roseate dream, and the message that he
bears a vocal incense from the flower&rsquo;s
glowing heart.</p>
<p>But if the burden of the one-half of
the tanager duet is &ldquo;my love is like a red,
red rose,&rdquo; the other half probably completes
the flowery simile, with the proud
refrain, &ldquo;my love is like a green, green
leaf,&rdquo; and when the time of the bloom of
the rose is past and the rosy plumes, like
petals, fall away, he stands revealed an
olive calyx, attended as the season wanes
by an assemblage of belated olivaceous
buds, whose song and carmine tints are
folded away to await the summons of the
next year&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<p>And when they return to us again in
the full flower of their beauty from their
southern home, gorgeous as if stained in
the dyes of the tropic sun, their song is
said to be suffused with color like the
mellow tones of the rose-breasted grosbeak
and oriole.</p>
<p>This song Nuttall describes as a strong
and sonorous whistle like that of the Baltimore
bird, &ldquo;resembling the trill or musical
shake on the fife, and is frequently
repeated; while that of the female is chattering
and is chiefly uttered in alarm
when any person approaches the vicinity
of the nest. From the similarity of her
color to the foliage of the trees, she is
rarely seen and is usually mute, while the
loquacity and brilliancy of the male, as he
flies timidly and wildly through the
branches, render him a most distinguished
and beautiful object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Audubon pronounced the usual note of
this bird as unmusical, resembling the
sounds &ldquo;chicky-chucky-chuck,&rdquo; which is
not, indeed, suggestive of poetic inspiration
on the part of this &ldquo;poet-prophet of
the spring,&rdquo; but the same author states
that during the spring he sings pleasantly
for nearly half an hour in succession,
and that the song resembles that of the
red-eyed vireo, his notes being sweeter
and more varied and nearly equal to those
of the orchard oriole.</p>
<p>Mr. Ridgway describes the song as
somewhat after the style of the robin, but
in a firmer tone and more continued, and,
as compared with that of the scarlet tanager,
with which he is often confounded,
it is more vigorous and delivered in
a manner less faltering. He describes
the note of anxiety as a peculiar &ldquo;pa-chip-it-tut-tut-tut,&rdquo;
very different from the
weaker cry of Pyranga rubra.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman says the summer tanager
may be easily identified, not alone by its
color, but by its unique call note, a clearly
enunciated &ldquo;chicky-tucky-tuck.&rdquo; Its song
bears a general resemblance to that of the
scarlet, but to some ears is much sweeter,
better sustained and more musical. According
to some authorities it equals the
robin&rsquo;s in strength, but is uttered more
hurriedly, is more &ldquo;wiry&rdquo; and much more
continued.</p>
<p>Of the bird of Eastern North America
Mr. Maynard says: &ldquo;When the cold
north winds cease to blow and the air
in the piny woods is redolent with the
perfume of the sundew, creeping mimosa
and other delicate plants, which only
bloom late in the spring, the voices of
the summer tanagers are heard in the tops
of the highest trees, when their songs are
full of wild melody in perfect keeping
with their surroundings. * * * So
closely do they conceal themselves in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
thick foliage that were it not for the loud
song notes, which are constantly repeated,
it would be difficult to discover them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From one of its habits the Rose Tanager
is known to farmers as the red bee
bird, and, although a bird of day, its
taste for nocturnal beetles often leads it
to the pursuit of its prey until the shades
of evening have darkened into night,
when, with the light of its plumes extinguished,
as it were, with the setting
sun, it proceeds silently and invisibly
upon its gustatorial mission.</p>
<p>But it is credible that it is only when
he is in his colorless nocturnal disguise
that the prosaic beetle is permitted to refresh
this Avian bloom, and that when
the god of day has transformed the voiceless
shade of night into the winged and
musical rose of ornithology for his life&rsquo;s
sustenance, the same moment witnesses
the miracle of the &ldquo;dewdrops the sunrise
has reddened to wine,&rdquo; and that to his inspiration
is poured Aurora&rsquo;s rosy libation,

<h2 id="c18">THE ERMINE.</h2>
<p>The Ermine is an aristocratic branch
of the weasel family. His coat of pure
or creamy white is the envy of kings,
nobles and judges, whose robes of state
or office etiquette prescribes shall be lined
or faced with this matchless fur. A narrow
band of the same is turned up
around the crimson velvet cap worn beneath
the British monarch&rsquo;s crown and
the coronets of peers.</p>
<p>At the coronation of King Edward
and Queen Alexandra, which is to succeed
the period of mourning for the late
queen, the royal regalia will be brought
into requisition, and in all its magnificent
makeup not the least feature will be the
priceless ermine trimming, costing the
life of many a luckless animal. In view,
therefore, of his constant exposure to
martyrdom the price the Ermine pays for
his social distinction is dear enough and
should excite in his humbler cousins,
even were they disposed to be sensitive
on the point of birth, more of pity than
of jealousy.</p>
<p>He dresses in perfection, however,
only in winter, and that of the coldest regions,
where the exceeding whiteness of
his covering serves the two-fold purpose
of retaining heat and concealing his presence
on the universal carpet of snow,
both from the enemies seeking his life
and from the prey on which he subsists.</p>
<p>For a summer outing suit nature provides
him an unconventional dress of
light reddish brown varied with a stomacher
of tawny white. With the doffing
of his regal attire he also lays aside the
distinguished title of Ermine and becomes
plain Mr. Stoat.</p>
<p>This species of the weasel is found
throughout Great Britain and in most
parts of continental Europe, but except
in northern Scotland, Scandinavia, and
Russia the winters are neither sufficiently
long nor cold to produce a complete
change of color and he is left with a
funny piebald coat which no one covets.
The skins that supply the markets of the
world all come from the arctic countries
of the three northern continents, Europe,
Asia and North America. A permanent
feature of the Ermine&rsquo;s coat is the glossy
black tail tip, which in the preparation
of the fur is inserted at regular intervals
on the white, where the sharp contrast
gives a most pleasing effect.</p>
<p>An utter abhorrence of uncleanness is
a characteristic instinct of his lordship,
and impels him to suffer capture or death
rather than become soiled or bedraggled.
This sentiment of purity is figuratively
transferred to the fur whose use on the
garments of rulers and judges symbolizes
the purity of justice and law.</p>
<p>Determination and perseverance are
qualities displayed in the pursuit of game
for food, consisting of small herbivorous
animals, birds, and eggs. In length the
Ermine&rsquo;s body is about ten inches; the
tail, four inches; the legs are short, bearing
the slender body with a creeping
snake-like motion.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c19">THE RHESUS MONKEY.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Macacus rhesus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>It was in Simla that we first encountered
the Rhesus Monkey. We had gone
up to Simla to escape the intense heat of
Bombay, and, refreshed by the cool air of
the &ldquo;hill country,&rdquo; we were soon ready
to make the expedition to the hill called
Jako. This hill is indeed the hill of the
monkeys. It is eight or nine thousand
feet above the level of the sea, and here
lives a fakir, who feeds the monkeys as
they troop down the mountainside at his
call.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there is no more mischievous
monkey than the Rhesus, but,
after all, he is not altogether to blame,
for the blame may belong to the Hindoos.
Some tell us that the Rhesus Monkey is
sacred; others think not. But, however
that may be, it is a fact that the Hindoos
protect the monkeys in every possible
way, willingly sharing their food with
the bands which are found almost everywhere,
and permitting no one to kill
them.</p>
<p>This fosters every mischievous trait in
these monkeys, and they fear nothing
from man. They will devastate every
plantation and garden near them. They
belong to that genus of the ape family
called Macaque, and as this variety, with
their near relations, the other macaques,
are found all over Southeastern Asia, besides
one branch in Western Africa, one
can readily see that their mischievousness
becomes a serious drawback.</p>
<p>The natives of Baka are said to leave
one-tenth of their harvests in heaps for
the monkeys, which come down in great
numbers and carry away all that is left
for them. And this they can readily do
on account of their well-developed cheek
pouches. These pockets in the cheeks
are assuredly most convenient, but are
never found on American monkeys. The
Old World monkeys are the narrow-nosed
variety, while the American monkeys
have the broad nose bone.</p>
<p>Our Rhesus Monkeys had, of course,
the narrow nose bone. They averaged
about twenty inches long, and the tail
was half as long. Like all the macaque
monkeys, they were of sturdy build, with
legs of moderate length. In color the fur
was grayish or greenish on the upper
part, yellowish over the hips and white
below. The tail was greenish above and
gray under. The face, ears and hands
were of a light copper color.</p>
<p>The mother monkeys were most assiduous
in the care of their young, but in
educating them one of the most important
lessons was to teach them to steal
successfully. This the pupils learned
with ease, and to find a Rhesus Monkey
which could not steal would be a curiosity
indeed.</p>
<p>While in Simla we were told the oft-repeated
story of Lady Barker&rsquo;s dinner.
Lady Barker, desiring to give a dinner to
a large number of guests, took unusual
pains in the preparation of the feast.
With her own hands she arranged the
flowers, and in the most attractive manner
were placed upon the table all the
delicacies possible to procure, far and
near. When everything was arranged
to her entire satisfaction, she retired to array
herself for the reception of her guests.
The servants were left in charge of the
rooms, but instead of watching the tables,
they deserted their posts to amuse themselves
in a more congenial way. Imagine
the surprise and consternation when,
upon descending to the dining room, she
found it filled with guests, but not those
whom she had invited. A large band of
monkeys had entered through the windows
and were enjoying themselves without
restraint. Poor Lady Barker had
nothing left to offer her invited guests
but the spoiled remains of her sumptuous
feast. Her little lap-dog &ldquo;Fury&rdquo;
met with an untimely death by the hands
of probably this same band of monkeys.
The dog waged war on the creatures
at every opportunity, but one day a large
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
monkey managed to catch him and carry
him along to its tree-top. There the dog
was tormented by all the monkeys, being
passed from hand to hand and finally
thrown down a precipice.</p>
<p>While the Rhesus is an intelligent creature
and easily taught while young, it
it a question whether one really wishes
this monkey for a pet, for when old, they
become vicious and spiteful and can bite
and scratch in a dangerous manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the fruit and seeds which
they eat, they are also fond of insects and
spiders, and frequently large parties may
be seen searching the ground for these
delicacies.</p>
<p>Professor Ball relates an interesting anecdote
of these monkeys. He said that
when at Malwa Tal, a lake where he
spent a day, he was warned that when
passing under a certain landslip which
slopes to the lake, he would be liable to
have stones thrown at him by the monkeys.
As he thought this might be only a
traveler&rsquo;s tale, he took pains to go to the
spot in order to see what had given rise
to the story. As he approached the base
of the landslip, he saw a number of Rhesus
monkeys rush to the sides and across
the top, and presently pieces of loosened
stone and shale came tumbling down
where he stood. He soon satisfied himself
that this was not accidental, for he
distinctly saw one monkey, industriously
with both forepaws, push the loose
shingle off a shoulder of rock. He then
tried the effect of throwing stones at
them, but this made them quite angry and
the amount of fragments which they set
rolling was speedily doubled. This adventure
caused Professor Ball to believe
that there may be some truth in the
stories related in regard to monkeys
throwing fruit at people from the tree
tops, and yet even about monkeys it is
not always best to credit all one hears.</p>

<p>Our first experience with this curious
Animal Torpedo was on the borders of the
Llanos, a few days&rsquo; journey to the south
of Valencia. The pack mules, usually
very slow, had preceded us, during the
noon hour, while we had leisurely taken
luncheon. In the course of an hour, we
caught up with them, as they had reached
a sluggish estuary of a neighboring
river. Before we were in hailing distance,
we could see, from the wild and
frantic gesticulations of the muleteer,
that something unusual had occurred. It
proved to be an attack of electric eels
upon the first mule, which had attempted
to ford the lagoon. The animal had
nearly reached the opposite shore before
the attack was made, and thus, the first
mule had escaped with only a few shocks
from the invisible torpedoes. The other
pack mules, just entering the stream,
were turned upon savagely by the concealed
serpents, and were wildly and
frantically turning back, when we came
upon the scene. Their distended nostrils
and bulging, terrified eyes, with excited
snorting and plunging, would have
made a perfect picture of agonized terror.
Their suffering, fortunately, was of
short duration, as they soon gained the
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
shore and dashed away madly over the
prairie. The first mule, which had
crossed, terrified by the electric shocks
received, had retreated from the lagoon
and, in a state of great fright, had
plunged into a browsing herd of cattle,
dangling its swaying pack and causing
a frightened stampede among the half-wild
herd. The latter, ignorant of the
immediate peril, rushed toward the lagoon
ford, and, if those in front hesitated,
they were persistently prodded by
those from behind. In a moment all
were in the midst of their dreaded enemies
in the water. A scene followed
which is hard to describe. The poor
brutes reared, bellowed and moaned;
they gored each other in their agony,
while their startled eyes seemed ready to
jump from their sockets.</p>
<p>As the herd was numerous, the greater
portion soon struggled out, and, with
tails reared high in the air, they plunged,
like maddened demons, across the
prairie. Three cows and a heifer remained
in the pool with the eels. The
former, much exhausted, finally escaped
from their tormentors, but the heifer, unable
to withstand the repeated attacks,
made one last effort, and, with a gasp,
sank below the surface.</p>
<p>We spent some time in collecting our
terrified pack mules and scattered baggage,
finally crossing the bayou at a shallow
point some distance above the ford.
In the meantime, one of the mozos
speared one of the eels, as they had become
very sluggish and were swimming
aimlessly about the surface, after having
spent so much of their galvanic force.
The captured specimen was about two
and a half feet in length and would
weigh about eight pounds. It had an
olive green color and the upper part of
the head was mingled with red. Two
rows of yellow spots are placed symmetrically
along the back, each spot containing
an execretary aperture, which were
its galvanic batteries. It possessed an
enormous swimming bladder, which accounts
for its great agility and swiftness
in the water. The creature looks more
like a fish than an eel, and is very difficult
to capture in nets, owing to its agility
and a habit of burying itself in the mud
when frightened. The electric action of
the eel depends entirely upon its own will
and a shock can be given whether it is
touched by one or both hands to complete
the circuit. When wounded, their
power is almost destroyed and they are
able to give only feeble shocks. Humboldt
describes putting both feet upon a
newly-captured specimen, which rendered
him entirely powerless for a considerable
time. The shock was so great
that he suffered all day from pains in his
knee and back.</p>
<p>Though caught easily with a harpoon,
the natives have such an intense dread of
them that it is difficult for naturalists to
secure specimens. The peons have an
idea that one can escape the shock, while
going through waters infested by the
eels, if he carries a chew of tobacco in his
mouth. This supposed influence of tobacco
upon animal electricity is not entirely
without some scientific basis, but
in the form of a quid in the mouth it is,
of course, purely imagination.</p>
<p>It is not an uncommon thing for a
large colony of these eels, to attack and
drown a horse in mid-stream, which they
will leisurely devour afterwards. It is
recorded that, during the patriot wars in
Venezuela, a large army marching
through the Llanos was seriously disabled
in crossing a bayou infested with
these mischievous creatures. At Damarara,
British Guiana, in the early days,
these eels were employed by the medical
fraternity, to cure paralytic troubles, just
as the torpedo fish was employed by the
ancient Greeks.</p>

<h2 id="c21">THE CAMEL.</h2>
<p>We were on the road to Biskra, the
&ldquo;Queen of the Desert.&rdquo; Sand, sand
everywhere, as we looked across the
dreary spaces as far as the eye could
reach. Frequently the monotony was relieved
by the long lines of caravans passing
to and fro; they were picturesque
and poetical; they moved with stately
motion and graceful swing across the
background of never-ending and often
shifting sand.</p>
<p>Had this been our only experience
with the Camels which compose the caravans,
we would have returned with glowing
accounts and waxed eloquent over
these beasts of burden. We would have
assured our friends of their patience and
fortitude and with growing enthusiasm
described the showy trappings and effective
poses which charmed us on the desert
road. But alas! We came to know
the Camel well at close range and truly
&ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Camels about Biskra were the
long-legged variety commonly called
Dromedaries. They had but one hump
and averaged from about six and one-half
to seven and one-half feet in height; and
from muzzle to tip of tail they measured
ten or eleven feet. While the majority
were of a light sandy color, it was not
impossible to find a white, grey, brown or
even black Camel, but a black Camel was
held in great contempt by the Arabs. The
hair was irregular in length and almost
woolly in places. The callouses, large and
prominent, were found on the breast and
joints of the legs, making cushions for the
beast to rest upon when lying down or
kneeling. These callous places, scarcely
showing at birth, grow with advancing
age.</p>
<p>It is true that these animals, ungainly
and uncouth at near view, are indispensable
to the Arab of the desert; but all
their generations of domestic life have
failed to cultivate in their stupid minds
any affection or care for their masters.
Their obedience is passive and their apparent
patience only stupidity, for they
are unamiable, obstinate and disagreeable.</p>
<p>The Camel varies nearly as much as do
the horses of our own country. There
are many grades and degrees from the
ordinary baggage Camel to the high-toned
thoroughbred which corresponds
to our high-class race horse. These racing
Camels are long-legged and long-necked,
the hump stands upright; is conical
in shape and covers about one-fourth
of the length of the body; the head is
rather short, the eyes large and dull, and
the ears very small but mobile. The hair
is especially fine and soft.</p>
<p>A friend of ours who owned a fine
saddle Camel was able to make from
eighty to ninety miles a day if his Camel
was well fed and watered and was allowed
a rest at noon. This pace he was
able to continue without injury for three
or four consecutive days, and after a
well earned rest he could repeat the journey.</p>
<p>A baggage Camel, carrying a load of
perhaps three hundred pounds, would not
make over thirty miles a day, but could
often march twelve hours or longer without
rest. However, a man of position
would never condescend to ride on a baggage
Camel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i1056.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="500" />
<p class="caption">ASIATIC OR BACTRIAN CAMEL.
<br />(Camelus bactrianus.)</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Our friend told us that in buying saddle
Camels for our desert ride we would
be obliged to pay about sixty-five dollars
each, and that we must look for those
with soft backs, those which did not require
the whip and would not cry when
getting up or lying down. But he added
that with these excellent traits we must
not expect too much, for the best Camel
was capable of every fault associated
with a vicious disposition. And, indeed,
when, some days later, our favorite Camel,
when passing an Arab riding a
donkey, turned his head suddenly and
gave the man&rsquo;s arm a vicious bite, we
were well satisfied that our friend&rsquo;s estimate
of the Camel&rsquo;s disposition was absolutely
correct. The wound inflicted by
our animal was very severe, as the bite
of a Camel usually is. We sought our
friend&rsquo;s aid in adjusting the matter and
he related some of his experiences with
this ungrateful animal.</p>
<p>At one time he was the owner of a
Camel to which he had always been especially
kind. He started on a journey
across the desert, and after annoying him
in every possible way with a continued
persistence surprising in so stupid a
beast, the Camel, in a fit of rage, broke
into a gallop, throwing the gentleman
from his saddle to the ground, trampled
upon him and then galloped away at its
own sweet will. We were also told that
when the natives found that their Camels
had a grudge against them, they so feared
the revengeful beasts that they would
place their clothing before the Camel and
hide themselves behind bushes. The animal
would then expend its rage upon the
clothing, trampling and tearing it; the
injury, real or imagined, would then be
forgotten.</p>
<p>As it is about impossible to retain one&rsquo;s
seat on a galloping Camel, they are
trained only to trot. &ldquo;The steady, alternating
movement of the legs on the opposite
side of the animal stops the sideways
jolting motion, and if the rider
skillfully lies back in his saddle, he experiences
no more inconvenience from
the still somewhat violent shaking up
than he would if he were on horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After purchasing our Camels, we began
to study the habits and needs of our
new acquisitions. We found ourselves
obliged to provide food of a kind that
caused us some surprise. Our Camels
were far from fastidious. In fact, the
poorer the food, the better it seemed to
suit the needs of these peculiar beasts for
the dryest of vegetation was acceptable.
Shrubs and thorny branches were rapidly
disposed of and one wondered that even
their callous mouths could take them
without injury. They were also fond of
small beans, peas and vetches and were
not averse to making a juicy meal on cultivated
fields. But this indulgence was
to be avoided, as it was liable to produce
inflammation and death.</p>
<p>The idea that Camels when working
could go very long periods without food
and water, we found to be erroneous. The
true ruminant has four stomachs; the
Camel has three divisions only. The first
two divisions are provided with cells or
pouches which can be closed by strong
muscles. These contain fluid only and it
is on account of this peculiar construction
that the animal can go several days without
water, but when traveling in the heat
of an African desert, at least every four
days, the Camel must have water, nourishment
and rest.</p>
<p>On account of their acute smell, they
will detect water at some distance and it
is really an interesting sight when thirsty,
tired-out Camels draw near to a well or
river. They lift their heads high in the air,
inhale long breaths with half-closed eyes,
lay their ears back and then start to run,
so that one has to sit firmly in the saddle
if he does not wish to be thrown out.
When the beasts finally reach the well
they crowd to the water and give themselves
up to the enjoyment of drinking.</p>
<p>The food supply, which assists the
Camel in times of fasting is stored in the
hump, which is really one great lump of
fat. In times of plenty this is firm and
pyramid-like in form, and may weigh as
much as thirty pounds, but after prolonged
hunger it will nearly disappear;
weighing perhaps only four to six
pounds.</p>
<p>This provision of nature, added to its
peculiar stomach, makes the Camel in
many respects the most useful of domestic
animals. It has been domesticated from
very early times. We know that they
were owned in great numbers four thousand
years ago. Pharaoh gave them as a
present to Abraham and the patriarch
Job had at one time a herd numbering
six thousand.</p>
<p>A baby Camel is a misshapen little
thing, but like all young animals it is
playful and interesting. It is about three
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
feet high when it enters the world, but in
a week&rsquo;s time is much larger. It is able
to follow its mother soon after birth. She
will defend her own to the extent of her
strength if needful.</p>
<p>The Camel is a true animal of the desert
and only thrives in hot, dry localities.
It is of little use in a mountainous country,
as it is a poor climber and cannot remain
in health when fed on luxuriant
vegetation.</p>
<p>In the water it is of still less use. Perhaps
because the desert is its &ldquo;native
heath,&rdquo; it holds an antipathy for water
and either cannot or will not swim, so the
crossing of a stream with a caravan becomes
a serious undertaking. Sir Samuel
Baker recounts his experience in
crossing the Atbara river (about three
hundred yards wide.) &ldquo;Water-skins
were inflated and passed under the belly
of the Camel like a girth. A man sat
upon its back while one or two swam by
its side as guides. As the current of the
river was rapid, the animal was usually
half a mile down stream before gaining
the opposite bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time after we became acquainted
with the one-humped Camel (the Dromedary)
of Africa, our journeyings took us
to the regions of Central Asia and there
we met for the first time the Bactrian or
two-humped Camel. This varies somewhat
from the Dromedary as it has a
larger body, shorter legs, longer and
thicker hair and is able to live in a cooler
climate and at a greater elevation. Although
stupid in intellect, like the Dromedary,
we must give it the credit of having
a much better disposition. It is of the
greatest use to its owners. Its hair, milk,
skin and flesh are all put to use. It is not
only used as a pack animal, but is harnessed
to carts as well. Put to use when
five years old, it will, with good treatment,
continue to work until its twenty-fifth
year. With its help, its owner is
able to climb mountains thirteen thousand
feet high, and to cross treeless wildernesses
where horses would soon perish.
It could not be replaced by any
other domestic animal. &ldquo;The horse is
the companion of the inhabitant of the
steppes,&rdquo; but the Bactrian Camel, the
&ldquo;Ship of Asia,&rdquo; is his faithful servant.</p>

<p class="caption">ZEBRA.
<br />(Equus zebra.)</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<h2 id="c23">THE ZEBRA.</h2>
<p>When passing through the zoological
garden one summer afternoon, my attention
was called to the antics of the fun-loving,
shy and graceful Zebra which
was delighting the children with his original
performance. There was no ringmaster
to indicate the various evolutions,
but Zebra Joe was furnishing a sort of
circus all by himself. He seemed to have
forgotten that he was a stranger in a
strange land, and could he have been
transported to his own country in South
Africa, I hardly imagine he would have
seemed gayer or more free.</p>
<p>The Zebra is of all things a freedom-loving
animal. He will go like the wind
and, if pursued singly, cannot be caught.
It is true that large herds are overtaken,
as they impede each other&rsquo;s progress,
but it is a shame that these beautiful
creatures should be hunted at all. The
European will try to kill them with bullets,
the natives with javelins, but more
frequently these dainty animals are
caught in pitfalls and then captured or
slain according to the will of the pursuer.</p>
<p>They live gregariously and are found
in groups of from ten to twenty, though
there are accounts of large herds. Probably
these were migrating. When running,
they usually go in single file, the
stallions leading. They are not very fastidious
in regard to their food, but if the
supply fails in one place they seek another
locality. The Zebra defends itself
from other animals by biting and kicking,
and the lion is about the only foe which
can overcome it.</p>
<p>Of the three species, the mountain
Zebra or true Zebra lives farthest south.
It ranges over the mountainous country
of Cape Colony. It is the smallest of the
three varieties, and is distinguished from
the others, not only by the peculiar markings,
but by the large ears, short mane
and scantily haired tail. It is the only variety
where the transverse markings of
the legs extend to the hoofs.</p>
<p>It is a very curious fact that the different
species of Zebra are never found
together. Perhaps they fear each other,
but they do not fear other animals, for
all agree that in the herds of quagga
(which is grouped with the Zebra) are
nearly always found spring-boks, gnus,
ostriches and also buffalos. Ostriches,
especially, are the companions of this
species of wild horse, which takes advantage
of the vigilance and sagacity of these
great birds. Some species of the Zebra
follow the horses of traveling parties and
graze among them, seeming to have a certain
friendship for the one-hoofed domestic
animals.</p>
<p>The Burchell&rsquo;s Zebra is the largest and
noblest appearing of the species. It is
a rover of the plains and does not seek
the mountainous districts where the true
Zebra is found. It stands about four and
one-half feet in height at the shoulders.
The general ground color of the hair
varies from white to yellowish brown
and the stripes are brown or black. The
hoofs are more like those of a pony than
the other species. It is not found south
of the Orange river and it is not known
how far north its range extends.</p>
<p>Our illustration shows an example of
Chapman&rsquo;s Zebra. This, in reality, is a
variety of Burchell&rsquo;s Zebra and should
not be considered apart from it.</p>
<p>The third species is called Gr&eacute;vy&rsquo;s Zebra.
More slender than the true Zebra,
it is somewhat like it in its markings.
&ldquo;Colonel J. A. Grant, who first met these
Zebras in the mountains north of Victoria
Nyanza, writes that they were found in
herds comprising from two to nine individuals.&rdquo;
He says that &ldquo;one of their
number, probably the largest male, takes
general charge of the herd; and it was
noticed that a large antelope kept watch
and gave the alarm on our appearance.
They are rarely found outside the forest,
preferring it to the open plain, which is
generally bare of grass; or they frequent a
country with clumps of dense brushwood,
or with outcrops of granite, around
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
which they get abundant food, and they
were never seen far from running water
or hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They showed much sympathy when a
comrade was wounded, lingering with the
hurt one at the risk of their lives; they
lingered with our laden donkeys one day
on the march.&rdquo; These Zebras are sometimes
found at an elevation of two or
three thousand feet.</p>
<p>There is a variety of opinion in
regard to the possibility of taming
the Zebra. Undoubtedly many incompetent
persons have made the
attempt and failed. It is claimed
that others have succeeded. There is a
record that a couple of beautiful animals
in England could be harnessed to a light
carriage and used like horses. On the
other hand, there is told the story of a
rich settler in Cape Colony who had
reared several Zebras. He had perfect
confidence in their docility and he thought
one day that he would have them harnessed
to his carriage. This he did, taking
the reins himself. The details of the
ride are lost to posterity, but in a very
short time the gentleman found himself
in their stable together with the remnants
of his carriage. This so discouraged his
friends and neighbors that they unanimously
declared the Zebra to be untamable
and they made no further attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All who have seen Zebras in their native
haunts, speak of the beautiful appearance
presented by a drove, as they
stand for a moment to gaze at the hunter,
and then wheel round to seek safety
in flight. It has been stated that, when
standing on sandy ground in full moonlight,
a Zebra harmonizes so exactly with
the color of its surroundings as to be quite
invisible at a short distance.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
